# SOA – State of the Art File Manager 🗂️

**SOA** is a powerful, extensible note and knowledge management tool designed to help you organize your work in a structured and efficient way. It supports multiple note styles and integrates with tools like Zotero to streamline your research workflow.

## ✍️ Commands

### `soa add question --from <from_file> <question text>`

Creates a markdown note in the `questions` directory under your `${SOA_DIR}`.  
The note is based on a predefined question style and links back to the specified source file.

### `soa sync literature`

This helps bridge your literature review process with your personal knowledge base.
